            <ul class = "listText"><li>Link To: <a href="https://github.com/Steelerfan840/Dice" target="new_window">The Dice Game</a></li>
              <br>
            <li>A great 2 player game I coded. You take turns rolling dice, you can keep your points or risk it for more. First player to 100 wins. I themed this game out with the  Pittsburgh Steelers. It turned out really nice.</li></ul>

              <br>
            <li>An entire game I created. You enter a number between 1 ans 20. It will tell you if you're high or low. You have 20 guesses to get it right. It even keeps high score.</li></ul>




            <div class = "heading">Hanoi Tower Challenge</div>
            <ul class = "listText"><li>Link To: <a href="https://github.com/Steelerfan840/hanoi_tower" target="new_window">Hanoi Tower Challenge</a></li>
              <br>
            <li>This is a challenge where you must take disk from one tower and put stack them on another tower. The trick is you can't stack a bigger disk on a smaller one. I solved this and wrote an algorithym to accomplish it with Javascript.</li></ul>

              <br>
            <li>Using Javascript I created these eyeballs. The eyeballs move across the screen following your mouse as if they are watching it. </li></ul>

                  <br>
                <li>This is a project I did that tracks bus routes along GPS coordinates. This is done using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.</li></ul>

                  <br>
                <li>This was a project that animates a PacMen. I created a couple buttons. One creates a PacMan everytime it is pushed and the other starts the animation. You can create as many PacMen as you want.</li></ul>
